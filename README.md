## Controlling the Containers

- `docker compose up -d` to start all the containers in the background
- `docker compose down` to shutdown and delete the containers
- `docker compose up db -d` only start the database container (replace db with the other services as needed)
- `docker compose stop` to "turn off" the containers but not delete them. 


### Getting Started with the RBAC 
1. We need to turn off the standard panel of links on the left side of the Streamlit app. This is done through the `app/src/.streamlit/config.toml` file.  So check that out. We are turning it off so we can control directly what links are shown. 
1. Then I created a new python module in `app/src/modules/nav.py`.  When you look at the file, you will se that there are functions for basically each page of the application. The `st.sidebar.page_link(...)` adds a single link to the sidebar. We have a separate function for each page so that we can organize the links/pages by role. 
1. Next, check out the `app/src/Home.py` file. Notice that there are 3 buttons added to the page and when one is clicked, it redirects via `st.switch_page(...)` to that Roles Home page in `app/src/pages`.  But before the redirect, I set a few different variables in the Streamlit `session_state` object to track role, first name of the user, and that the user is now authenticated.  
1. Notice near the top of `app/src/Home.py` and all other pages, there is a call to `SideBarLinks(...)` from the `app/src/nav.py` module.  This is the function that will use the role set in `session_state` to determine what links to show the user in the sidebar. 
1. The pages are organized by Role.  Pages that start with a `0` are related to the *Political Strategist* role.  Pages that start with a `1` are related to the *USAID worker* role.  And, pages that start with a `2` are related to The *System Administrator* role.
